# Why Storybook

### helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context

- makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states

### Save these UI states as _stories_ to revisit during development, testing, or QA

### to build, test and visualize UI components in isolation

### runs alongside your app in development mode

### build our UI following a [Component-Driven Development](https://www.componentdriven.org/) (CDD) methodology
