# React Components

## Basics

### Component Name
- Component name should be **capitalized** and be the same as the component file name

### Component Export
- To separate the component from the entrance file `App.js`, we need to use `export default function` instead of `function` alone.
- Can only used on the main component

### `return()`
- Each component returns a piece of JSX code to be rendered on page
