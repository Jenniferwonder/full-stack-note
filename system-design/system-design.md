## Client-Server Model

### DNS query > IP address

- IP address
  - Unique identifier for a machine
  - Like a mailbox some entity has granted to a machine
  - on Unix
    - `dig google.com`
      - will return IP address

### HTTP request to IP address

- able to send information that server understands
- be packed into package
- contain _source address_ of the request
  - the address of the browser
  - for the server to know where it should send a response to
- Ports
  - Server listens for request on specific ports
    - Any machine with a distinct IP address has 16000 ports that programs can listen to
  - need to specify what port you want to communicate on
  - Most clients know the port that they should use depending on the protocol they speak to the server with
    - HTTP
      - Port: 80
    - HTTPS
      - Port: 443
    - Unix tool: netcat
      - `nc -l 8081`
      - `nc 127.0.0.1 8081`
        - A special IP address that always point to your local machine
        - Enter a communication channel
        - Then when typing information on this terminal, the info will appear in the other terminal too
      - allow to read from or write to connections using certain protocols

### Server responds

### Browser receives the server's response and renders HTML on the page
