## Features

What makes Vim interesting is that it is highly configurable and customizable so the use of plugins in it can be possible.
These plugins had to be downloaded manually distributed as tarballs and extracted into a directory called ~/.vim.
Handling plugins in this way is not a problem at first glance, but when too many were used it could result in a big mess, since all the files for each plugin were concentrated in a single directory.
This is where Vimâ€™s plugin managers come in handy.

- Plugin managers keep the files of installed plugins in a separate directory, so it is very easy to manage all the plugins
- minimalistic, open source and free vim plugin manager that can install or update plugins in parallel.
- It creates clones to minimize disk space usage and download time. Supports on-demand plugin loading for faster startup time.
- Other notable features are branch support, tag, link, post-update, support for externally managed plugins, etc.
