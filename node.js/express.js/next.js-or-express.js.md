## Next.js or Express?

### ExpressJS vs NextJS features

#### 1. Some ExpressJS features are:

- Robust routing
- HTTP helpers (redirection, caching, etc)
- View system supporting 14+ template engines

#### 2. Next.js provides the following key features:

- Zero setup. Use the filesystem as an API ( You do not need Express to build a full-stack application)
- Server-Side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Single-Page application (SPA)
- Development of faster applications
- Optimization of pages
- SEO websites
- Automatic code splitting

### Conclusion

Express.js is a **backend framework for building APIs** whereas Next.js is a **full stack framework that builds upon React** to improve the SEO, development experience, and performance of your project. One of these features IS a built-in API routing system that **could** replace Express.js.  
It all depends on the case you have and your personal preference. If you are building a private page (admin panel that can only be accessed with authentication) that does not need to be found by search engines, you do not need Next.js and will need Express.js. If you are building a public website (e.g. e-commerce website) and you are using Next.js for SEO optimization, you **could** replace Express.js with it.  
**TLDR;** You can replace an Express API with NextJS's API routing system but that only makes sense if you're building a full-stack React project. If it's a standalone API, using Next.js to replace just that API doesn't make any sense.  
Next.js on its own is a powerful tool. When combined with Express, it makes a sacred combination. Using Express with Next.js, you can:

### Why use Express with [Next.js](Next.js)?

- Easily build web socket features in your applications
- Develop custom or extra logic for your Next.js routes
- Build Express middleware and fetch data for Next.js pages before they are rendered
- Easily build backend features, such as file uploading, media file compression, and more

### Advantages of using Express with Next.js

The great thing about Next.js is that there are a lot of advantages, not only for the developers, but also for the users and business owners using Next.js in the technology stack.  
For developers, Next.js has:

- A growing community of experienced developers and contributors, hence easy adoption by other developers and easy-to-find solutions to any issues you might face while learning and using Next.js
- An automatic feature that helps you optimize images, and has automatic lazy-loading, preloading of critical images, correct sizing across devices, and supports modern formats.
- A faster browser refresh rate while you’re developing
- Out-of-the-box support for TypeScript
- Automatic compilation and bundling so you don’t waste time with a lot of configurations to get your application running
- Easy creation of API routes or endpoints during application development
- Content rendering in multiple ways. You can prerender with server-side rendering or static site generation, or can update or create your application content at runtime with incremental static regeneration  
  Some other advantages of using Express with Next.js also include:
- Data security: websites created with Next.js are static and don’t have a direct connection with your application database, user information, third-party integration keys, and any other sensitive information
- Search engine endliness: because Next.js websites load fast and are easy to scan by search engine bots, this improves organic traffic to the website and can translate to conversions and sales for the owner of the website
- Cross deployment: you can use Next.js to build across several platforms. You can build Static web applications, Progressive Web Apps (PWA), and even mobile apps using Next.js
